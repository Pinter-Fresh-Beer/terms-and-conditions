**WARRANTY TERMS**

**This is a Limited Warranty.**

---

**1. OVERVIEW**

This Limited Warranty applies to the Pinter and Co-Pinter device ("Product") purchased directly from The Greater Good Fresh Brewing Company or Pinter USA Group Inc. ("Pinter," "we," "us," or "our"). It sets out what is covered, how long the cover lasts, and how you can make a claim.

This Limited Warranty is in addition to any statutory rights you may have.

This Limited Warranty applies only to the original purchaser and is non-transferable.

---

**2. WARRANTY PERIOD**

We warrant that the Product will be free from defects in materials and workmanship for **12 months** from the date it is originally purchased by the end user ("Warranty Period").

This Limited Warranty applies to the Pinter and Co-Pinter device only. Pinter Packs are covered separately under our Freshness & Quality Guarantee (see section 7).

---

**3. WHAT WE WILL DO**

If a defect in materials or workmanship arises during the Warranty Period, we will, at our discretion:

- Replace the Product (in full or with a replacement part) with the same model or a substantially similar model; or
- Provide a refund if repair or replacement is not commercially reasonable.

If the Product is repaired or replaced, the repaired or replacement Product is covered for the remainder of the original Warranty Period or 90 days from the date of repair or replacement, whichever is longer.

---

**4. EXCLUSIONS**

This Limited Warranty does not cover:

- Damage resulting from misuse, abuse, accident, neglect, improper cleaning, or failure to follow the operating instructions
- Damage resulting from unauthorised repair, modification, or disassembly
- Cosmetic damage or wear that does not affect functionality (including marks, scratches, discolouration); normal wear and tear of consumable parts such as seals, valves or gaskets
- Use of the Product in a commercial or non-domestic environment; or
- Any malfunction, damage, or performance issue that we reasonably determine to have been caused, directly or indirectly, by the use of third-party or incompatible products or ingredients. If this appears to be the case, we'll review the issue based on an inspection - either by looking at the Product itself or by reviewing photos - and any available evidence.

> **Note:** Nothing in this Limited Warranty affects your statutory rights.

---

**5. INSPECTION AND EVALUATION**

When you make a warranty claim, we may:

- Request return of the Product (or relevant components) for inspection
- Ask for proof of purchase
- Ask for the serial number of the Product
- Request information relating to the ingredient packs used including the batch number
- Request photographic or written documentation describing the issue; and
- Issue a written determination regarding whether the claim is covered

If we determine that the issue is not covered under this Limited Warranty, we will notify you in writing.

**7. FRESHNESS & QUALITY GUARANTEE (PINTER PACKS)**

Pinter Packs are guaranteed to arrive in good condition and remain usable until the 'BBE' (UK) or 'Best if used by' (US) date printed on the pack.

**8. STATUTORY RIGHTS**

**UK Customers**

Your statutory rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 apply in addition to this Limited Warranty. You are entitled to goods that are of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose, and as described. This Limited Warranty does not limit or replace those rights.

**US Customers**

This Limited Warranty is provided in accordance with the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. Any implied warranties are limited to the duration of this Limited Warranty, unless prohibited by state law. Some states do not allow limitations on implied warranties or the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so these limitations may not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.

---

**9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be responsible for:

- Indirect, incidental, or consequential losses; or
- Loss of ingredients, brewed beverages, or other consumables.

Some states do not allow limitations on implied warranties or the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so these limitations may not apply to you.

We do not exclude or limit liability where the law does not allow us to do so, including liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or fraud.
