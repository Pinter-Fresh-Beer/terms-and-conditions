SUBSCRIPTIONS AND AUTO DELIVERY

Rolling Monthly Subscription.

When you subscribe to auto-delivery, you’ll receive recurring deliveries of Pinter Packs.

A minimum of two packs is required in your first subscription order. After your first subscription order, these can be changed through your account page.

Your payment details will be securely stored, and you’ll be charged for each scheduled delivery every 4 weeks, unless you choose to pay in advance using the send ASAP feature. If you do not wish to renew, you can cancel at any time after your first recurring subscription order. You can modify or cancel after your first recurring order in your account page, although any changes must be made before 11:59pm the day before your subscription renews. Once a subscription order has shipped, it cannot be returned or refunded, however, future subscription orders can be paused or canceled at any time after your first recurring subscription order.

For more details on returns and refunds, please refer to our returns policy.

If you don't select a Fresh Beer before your subscription date (or if your selected beer is out of stock and unchanged), you will receive the default beer at the time for that month. You can change the date of your monthly subscription as long as you haven’t changed within the last 3 months. To update your subscription date, please contact Customer Services and we'll be able to update it in your account.



PRICE DISCOUNTS & PROMOTIONS

If you have received a voucher or promotion from us, one of our partners, or from a friend (lucky you!), here's how they work:

They cannot be combined with any other offer or promotion.

They are usually limited to one per person.

Our vouchers are usually only redeemable for a set timeframe.

Our vouchers typically are only redeemable against a specific product and this cannot be exchanged for money off something else (ie you cannot use your discount off a Pinter against a Fresh press).

BUT please note, the offer does vary from voucher to voucher, so please refer to the voucher itself.

We do sometimes test the price of our products and/or offer discounts to make sure that we provide the best value to our customers, this may mean you get a price that isn't our lowest price. Due to the nature of these tests, we cannot make up the difference in prices for customers.

We operate a fair use policy on all promotional activity and reserve the right to cancel at any time.

In the unlikely event that your voucher or discount is not working, please get in touch with our Customer service Team via our website or email us at hello@pinter.co.uk who'll be happy to help.



DELIVERY

Once we’ve received payment, we will get your order ready for dispatch. Your anticipated delivery date will be in your order confirmation email – please allow until this date for your order to arrive. You’ll be able to get the latest updates on your order by clicking the tracking link in your shipping confirmation email. 


RETURNS

If you decide to return something to us, you will need to email hello@pinter.co.uk with details of your return within 14 days of receiving the product. The product will need to be in an unused condition in its original packaging. After this return has been authorised, you have an additional 14 days to return the product to us for a refund.

If the product is faulty, you have the right to return it for a refund within 30 days of receiving it.

If the product is faulty and it has been over 30 days since you have received it, we have the right to try to resolve the issue in the first instance, which could include repairing or replacing it. If a replacement or repair is unsuccessful in resolving the fault, you have the right to a refund.

The above does not apply if you are returning a faulty Pinter Pack that is outside its best before date as shown on the Fresh Press.

All Pinter Insiders will complete the sign-up questions ahead of joining.

All Pinter Insiders will agree to retaining confidentiality on anything discussed as part of the Pinter Insiders and will not discuss or share topics on social media.

Any Pinter Insiders found to be in breach of the confidentiality agreement will be removed from the Pinter Insiders group and will not be allowed readmittance.

Pinter Insiders can request to exit the group by contacting Customer Service.

Any particular customer issues relating to our product or services will be directed to, and handled by, the Customer Service team to align with all other customer support queries.

Any gifts provided as part of the Pinter Insiders cannot be exchanged for cash and will only be refunded if proved to be faulty.

Any expenses incurred for face to face groups will be discussed and agreed in advance.
