We do not respect browser Do Not Track settings for our analytics cookies, as we use analytics information to understand web traffic. This data is not shared with third parties.

## 5. Purposes for which we use Personal Data and the legal bases

We will only use your Personal Data when the law allows. Most commonly, we will use your Personal Data in the following circumstances:

| Purpose | Lawful Bases for Processing |
|---------|------------------------------|
| Responding to correspondence from you | It is in our legitimate interest to respond to enquiries made via our website, by email, through our social channels or any other means. |
| Setting up a customer account to facilitate purchases | When you set up an account with us, we process your data to satisfy the sales contract between us |
| Business management, forecasting and statistical purposes | It is our legitimate interest to identify areas for managing current business relationships, develop our services and for managing our business |
| Improving our website and the overall visitor and user website experience | It is our legitimate interest to allow analytics and search engine providers to help improve and optimise our website |
| Improving our website and the overall visitor and user website experience | We use cookies on our website with your consent. Cookies can be managed using your browser settings |
| Improving our website and the overall visitor and user website experience | We use location information to provide personalise marketing options to enhance your experience with tailored recommendations |
| Prevention and detection of crime, including money laundering, fraud, or other crimes | We have a legal obligation to report any such activity to the relevant authorities and regulators |
| Providing you with a newsletter containing offers, promotions and useful hints and tips | We rely on your consent to send you our newsletter. This consent may be withdrawn at any time by emailing privacy@pinter.co.uk or by contacting us by telephone or via our social media platforms |

## 6. Personalised In-App Content

### For Our UK Customers:

To make your experience more enjoyable and relevant, we personalise the content you see in the app — like news, tips, promotions, and helpful links — based on your interests and activity. You're welcome to manage or opt out of these personalised features anytime through the 'Notifications' settings. You're always in control of your data and may request deletion of your account and associated information at any time through the Delete Account option in the My Account screen in the Pinter app.

### For Our US Customers:

We tailor app content — including useful news, updates, and offers — to better match your experience and preferences. This personalisation is a standard part of our service and can't be turned off in the app. However, you're always in control of your data and may request deletion of your account and associated information at any time through the Delete Account option in the My Account screen in the Pinter app.

## 7. Sharing your data

It is unlikely that we will ever share your Personal Data outside the UK. If a business need arises and it becomes necessary for us to share your data outside the UK for the purposes of providing our services to you, we will only share it with organisations in countries which benefit from a UK Adequacy Regulation, or if not, by using the UK International Data Transfer Agreement, which contractually obliges the recipient to process and protect your Personal Data to the standard expected within the UK.

We may share your name, address, email address and transaction history with approved data agencies – they help us segment and model our data. It sounds very complicated, but these organisations help us to analyse our customer base and to identify potential new customers, and to target our marketing in a way that is most relevant for you. In all instances, we provide them with only the information they need to perform their function.

Our website includes links to other third-party websites and social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly known as Twitter)); when you navigate away from our site via one of the links, the site may collect your IP address and may set a cookie on your device. When you use one of these links, you're sharing information with another website or service and this Notice will no longer apply. Please read the privacy notices provided by the particular service website you are directed to before posting any personal information using these links.

## 8. How long we keep your data

We will retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary to provide you with our services and for a reasonable period thereafter to enable us to meet our contractual and legal obligations and to deal with complaints and claims.

At the end of the retention period, your Personal Data will be securely deleted or anonymised, for example by aggregation with other data, so that it can be used in a non-identifiable way for statistical analysis and business planning.

## 9. How we protect your data

We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect data against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.

In addition to the technical and organisational measures we have put in place, there are simple things you can do to in order to further protect your personal information, such as:

- Never share One Time Passcodes (OTPs)
- Never enter your details after clicking on a link in an email or text message
- Always send confidential information by encrypted email to reduce risk of interception
- If you are logged into any online service, do not leave your computer unattended
- Close down your internet browser once you have logged off
- Never download software or let anyone log on to your computer or devices remotely, during or after a cold call
- You can easily identify secure websites by looking at the address in the top of your browser which will begin https:// rather than http://
