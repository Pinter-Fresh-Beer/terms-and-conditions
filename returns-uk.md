**Refunds on Pinters Ordered with Subscription Offers**

We want you to enjoy brewing with your Pinter and feel confident in your subscription. If something’s not right, we’re here to help. If you'd like to return your Pinter after buying on a subscription offer, here is our policy:

---

**1. Cancel Before Your First Order Ships**

If your first order (including the Pinter and your first Pinter Packs) hasn’t shipped:

• Contact us via email or live chat before dispatch  
• We will cancel your order and issue a full refund to your original payment method

**2. Return Within 30 Days – Unused First Order**

If your first order has been delivered but remains unopened and unused — and it’s within 30 days of purchase:

• Contact us to request cancellation  
• Return the full shipment (Pinter and Pinter Packs) unused  
• Once we receive the return or proof of return, we’ll issue a full refund

**3. Used First Order or Outside 30-Day Guarantee**

If you’ve used your first shipment, or it’s been more than 30 days since purchase, you’re not eligible for a full refund — but you still have options:

**Option A – Second Order Not Yet Shipped**  
• Pay a £99 hardware fee to keep your Pinter  
• We’ll cancel your second shipment and stop your subscription  

**Option B – Second Order Already Shipped**  
• Pay a £99 cancellation fee to keep your Pinter  
• We’ll cancel your subscription  
• If you return the second Pinter Pack unopened, we’ll refund the pack’s value once we receive it or proof of return

**4. Cancel After Your First Subscription Order**

If you’ve already been charged for your first subscription order:

• You can cancel anytime to stop future shipments  
• Refunds are not available for any orders already processed or shipped

**Other Returns**

If you decide to return something to us, you will need to email hello@pinter.co.uk or via webchat with details of your return within 14 days of receiving the product. The product must be unused and in its original packaging. After your return is authorised, you have an additional 14 days to send it back for a refund.

If the product is faulty, you have the right to return it for a refund within 30 days of receiving it.

If the product is faulty and it has been over 30 days since receipt, we have the right to attempt to resolve the issue first — this may include a repair or replacement. If that fails, a refund will be issued.

Please note: this does not apply if you are returning a faulty Pinter Pack that is outside its best before date as shown on the Fresh Press.

**Your Pinter and Co-Pinter Warranty**

All Pinters and Co-Pinters include a 12-month warranty from the date of delivery. This covers product faults but does not cover accidental damage or misuse (e.g. using ingredients not supplied in a Pinter Pack).

You’ll receive an email to register your warranty once your Pinter ships. If gifting, you can forward this to the recipient. Second-hand Pinter owners must contact the original purchaser for the order number and complete the transfer form.

If you'd like to make a warranty claim, complete the form first, then contact hello@pinter.co.uk or via webchat with details and a photo of the issue. Our team may request additional photos or information to determine the best solution. If a fault is confirmed, we may replace the faulty part or the full unit depending on the case.

**Faulty, Missing or Incorrect Items**

If your order is faulty or incorrect, contact us at hello@pinter.co.uk or via webchat with your order details, issue, and supporting photos where possible.

Product images on our website and app are for illustration only. The actual product may vary.

Packaging may also vary from that shown online.

**Fair wear and tear:** Faults resulting from fair wear and tear are not covered under your rights.
