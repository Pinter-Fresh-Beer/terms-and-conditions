When you sign up for our flexible auto-delivery service, you agree to receive a recurring shipment of Pinter Packs every 4 weeks. Each subscription order includes a minimum of **2 Pinter Packs**.

You will be charged for your **first order at checkout**. This first order includes your Pinter and the selected beer packs. Future subscription orders will be billed automatically every 4 weeks on your plan date, and we’ll send an order confirmation email when each payment is processed.

Our subscription is **completely flexible**. **After your first recurring subscription shipment**, you may:
