**PRICE DISCOUNTS & PROMOTIONS**

If you have received a voucher or promotion from us, one of our partners, or from a friend (lucky you!), here's how they work:

They cannot be combined with any other offer or promotion.  

They are usually limited to one per person.  

Our vouchers are usually only redeemable for a set time frame.  

Our vouchers typically are only redeemable against a specific product and this cannot be exchanged for money off something else (ie you cannot use your discount off a Pinter against a Fresh press). BUT please note, the offer does vary from voucher to voucher, so please refer to the voucher itself.  

We do sometimes test the price of our products and/or offer discounts to make sure that we provide the best value to our customers, this may mean you get a price that isn't our lowest price. Due to the nature of these tests, we cannot make up the difference in prices for customers.  

We operate a fair use policy on all promotional activity and reserve the right to cancel at any time.

In the unlikely event that your voucher or discount is not working, please get in touch with our Customer service Team via email at [hello@pinter.com](mailto:hello@pinter.com) who'll be happy to help.

The Pinter Insiders isn’t a rule-based forum. We want customers to comment and communicate with us freely, intuitively and honestly.  
We just ask that everything discussed as part of the Pinter Insiders is kept confidential. This commitment allows us to share things with Pinter Insiders ahead of general release. Without this commitment, we can’t allow Pinter Insiders a window on our world - we will have to restrict the discussion topics and play much more safe with what we share. 

All Pinter Insiders will complete the sign-up questions ahead of joining.  

All Pinter Insiders will agree to retaining confidentiality on anything discussed as part of the Pinter Insiders and will not discuss or share topics on social media.  

Any Pinter Insiders found to be in breach of the confidentiality agreement will be removed from the Pinter Insiders group and will not be allowed readmittance.  

Pinter Insiders can request to exit the group by contacting Customer Service.  

Any particular customer issues relating to our product or services will be directed to, and handled by, the Customer Service team to align with all other customer support queries.  

Any gifts provided as part of the Pinter Insiders cannot be exchanged for cash and will only be refunded if proved to be faulty.  

Any expenses incurred for face to face groups will be discussed and agreed in advance.
